# Incident Detection, Analysis, and Response

Security attacks are ever-evolving, and professionals must respond to incidents like data breaches, ransomware, and employee errors. This course focuses on incident detection, providing practical experience with tools such as:
- **tcpdump**
- **Wireshark**
- **Splunk**
- **Suricata**
- **Chronicle**

By the end, youâ€™ll understand:
- The incident response lifecycle.
- Tools for log interpretation and alerts analysis.
- Packet sniffers to monitor and analyze traffic.

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

The NIST CSF is a major guideline in incident response. This course focuses on the steps: detect, respond, and recover.

## NIST Incident Response Lifecycle

This framework is the incident response cycle, consisting of:
1. **Preparation**
2. **Detection and Analysis**
3. **Containment**
4. **Eradication**
5. **Recovery**
6. **Post-Incident Activity** (lessons learned, documenting findings).

## Events vs. Incidents

- **Incident**: An event compromising confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
- **Event**: Any observable occurrence in a system or network.

## Incident Documentation

Documentation is crucial:
- **Incident Handler's Journal**: Records key details (who, what, when, where, and why).
- **Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs)**: Specialized teams responsible for managing and responding to incidents.

## Incident Response Plan (IRP)

Incident response plans are structured guides for addressing incidents efficiently and quickly. They include:
- Procedures, system information, contact lists, and templates.
- Must be tested regularly using tabletop exercises and simulations.

## Tools for Detection & Response

- **Documentation tools**: Word processors, ticketing systems, audio recorders, cameras, etc.
- **Packet sniffers**: Tools like Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic.
- **Investigative tools**: Analyze logs, monitor network activities, and check for malicious events.

## Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)

- **IDS**: Monitors and alerts security teams of suspicious activity.
- **IPS**: Actively blocks threats upon detection.

## Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tools

SIEM tools provide a centralized platform for:
- Collecting, normalizing, and analyzing log data.
- **Splunk** and **Chronicle** are commonly used to aggregate logs and spot threats.

## Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR)

SOAR extends SIEM by automating incident analysis and response, streamlining tasks for efficiency.

## Network Traffic Analysis

Understanding network traffic patterns is critical. Tools like tcpdump allow security professionals to:
- Detect abnormal traffic.
- Spot indicators of compromise (IOCs), e.g., unusual data transfers.

## Packet Analysis

Packet analysis helps investigate security incidents by examining individual packets of network data. Understanding the structure of IP headers and other network details allows professionals to detect:
- Suspicious activity like data exfiltration.

## Suricata

A powerful Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). This tool uses:
- Signatures for threat detection.
- It can generate alert logs and network telemetry logs to capture events.

## Using SIEM Tools (Splunk and Chronicle)

- **Splunk**: Analyzes event logs using its Search Processing Language (SPL).
- **Chronicle**: Allows UDM searches and raw log searches for in-depth analysis.

## Incident Response Process

The incident response lifecycle follows structured phases:
1. **Detection**: Alert triage identifies events worth investigating.
2. **Containment**: Limit damage from an ongoing attack.
3. **Eradication**: Remove malware or intruders.
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal.
5. **Post-Incident**: Review what happened, identify what can be improved.

## Alert Triage & Playbooks

- **Alert triage** helps security teams prioritize alerts based on urgency and severity.
- **Playbooks** offer step-by-step guidelines for incident responses, ensuring consistent and timely action.

## Logs & Telemetry

- **Logs**: Capture system events and network activities (types: syslog, JSON, etc.).
- **Telemetry**: (like packet captures) offers deeper insights into network traffic.

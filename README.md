# Google Cybersecurity Course Notes

Hey there! Welcome to my repository of notes from the Google Cybersecurity Course. I created these concise yet detailed notes to help anyone who might easily forget key concepts as they dive into the world of cybersecurity.

## What You’ll Find

- **Core Concepts**: A straightforward breakdown of essential topics like network security, incident response, and cryptography.
- **Quick Reference**: Notes designed to be easily digestible, perfect for quick reviews before tests or discussions.

## Why I Made This

I found myself wanting a handy reference for all the important stuff while taking the course. I hope these notes serve the same purpose for you! Whether you’re just starting out or brushing up on your skills, I think you’ll find them useful.

Feel free to take a look, and if you have any suggestions or feedback, I’d love to hear it!

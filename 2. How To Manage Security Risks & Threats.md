## CISSP Security Domains

1. **Security and Risk Management**: Outlining security aims and targets, reducing risk, ensuring compliance, business continuity planning, and understanding legal rules.
2. **Asset Security**: Safeguarding both digital and physical assets, covering data storage, upkeep, retention, and secure disposal.
3. **Security Architecture and Engineering**: Improving data security by using effective tools, systems, and processes, with an emphasis on shared responsibility within the organization.
4. **Communication and Network Security**: Managing and protecting physical networks and wireless communications, especially crucial for employees working remotely.
5. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Controlling access and permissions to secure data by ensuring users adhere to established policies. It involves four key elements:
   - **Identification**: Users confirm their identity (username, access card, biometrics).
   - **Authentication**: Verifying the claimed identity (password, PIN).
   - **Authorization**: Granting access levels based on verified identity and role.
   - **Accountability**: Tracking and recording user actions for auditing and security.
6. **Security Assessment and Testing**: Carrying out security control tests, gathering and examining data, and conducting security audits.
7. **Security Operations**: Conducting investigations, implementing preventative measures, and performing digital forensic investigations after a security incident to uncover the who, how, and why of the breach.
8. **Software Development Security**: Integrating secure coding practices throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

- **Threats**: Events or circumstances that could negatively impact an organization's assets, such as social engineering attacks like phishing.
- **Risks**: The likelihood of a threat occurring, rated at different levels (low, medium, high) based on potential damage and asset value.
- **Vulnerabilities**: Weaknesses that a threat could exploit. These can be technical (e.g., outdated firewall), procedural (e.g., weak passwords), or human (e.g., employee phishing victim).
- **Ransomware**: A type of malware attack where threat actors lock down an organization's data and demand a ransom. The dark web often plays a role in ransom negotiations and data leaks due to its anonymity.

## NIST Frameworks

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides frameworks to guide security professionals:

- **Risk Management Framework (RMF)**: A seven-step process to manage risk:
  1. Prepare
  2. Categorize
  3. Select
  4. Implement
  5. Assess
  6. Authorize
  7. Monitor

- **Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**: A set of standards, guidelines, and best practices for managing cybersecurity risk, broken down into five core functions:
  1. Identify
  2. Protect
  3. Detect
  4. Respond
  5. Recover

- **Special Publication 800-53**: A framework specifically for protecting information systems within the U.S. federal government.

## OWASP Security Principles

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) offers principles for enhancing security:

- **Minimize Attack Surface**: Reduce the points where a threat actor could potentially gain access.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Give users the minimum access they need to do their jobs.
- **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls.
- **Separation of Duties**: Avoid giving one person complete control over a critical process.
- **Keep Security Simple**: Avoid overly complex systems that are difficult to manage.
- **Fix Security Issues Correctly**: Address the root cause of security problems, not just the symptoms.

## Security Audits

Reviews of an organizationâ€™s security measures, often conducted by the company's own team, are used to bolster security and ensure compliance. Key elements include:

- Setting the scope and goals of the audit.
- Conducting a risk assessment to pinpoint threats and vulnerabilities.
- Assessing existing controls for effectiveness.
- Evaluating compliance with relevant regulations.
- Communicating findings and recommendations to stakeholders.

## Logs

Records of events within systems and networks. Key types include:

- **Firewall logs**: Track connections to and from the internet.
- **Network logs**: Record devices entering and leaving the network.
- **Server logs**: Track activity related to specific services like websites or email.

## SIEM Tools and Dashboards

- **SIEM Tools**: Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools collect and analyze log data in real time. SIEM dashboards visualize this data for security teams to provide insights into potential threats and the overall security posture.
- **Types of SIEM Tools**:
  - Self-hosted: Installed and managed by the organization.
  - Cloud-hosted: Managed by the SIEM provider.
  - Hybrid: A combination of both.
- **Common SIEM Tools**: Splunk Enterprise (self-hosted), Splunk Cloud (cloud-hosted), Google Chronicle (cloud-native).

## Playbooks

Manuals that guide security professionals through specific procedures. Incident response playbooks outline a structured six-phase approach to handle security incidents:

1. **Preparation**: Getting ready for incidents by defining procedures and roles.
2. **Detection and Analysis**: Spotting and understanding the nature of a potential breach.
3. **Containment**: Stopping the incident from causing further damage.
4. **Eradication and Recovery**: Removing traces of the incident and restoring systems.
5. **Post-Incident Activity**: Documenting, learning from, and improving based on the incident.
6. **Coordination**: Reporting the incident and sharing information effectively.

Playbooks ensure a consistent and effective response to security incidents, minimizing damage and downtime. They should be regularly updated to address emerging threats and incorporate lessons learned from past incidents.

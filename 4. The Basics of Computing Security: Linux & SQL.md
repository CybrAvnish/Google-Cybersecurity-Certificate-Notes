## 1. Operating Systems

An operating system (OS) manages computer hardware and software resources, acting as a bridge between applications and hardware. Key points to cover include:

### Basic Functions of OS:
- **Process management**: Scheduling tasks and execution.
- **Memory management**: RAM allocation.
- **File system handling**: Storage and retrieval.
- **Device management**: Managing input/output devices.
- **User interface**: Command-line or graphical interfaces.

### Types of Operating Systems:
- **Windows**: User-friendly, popular for personal and business use.
- **macOS**: Apple's proprietary OS, known for its security and smooth user experience.
- **Linux**: Open-source, highly customizable, and widely used in servers and cybersecurity.

### Security Role of OS:
The OS enforces access controls, file permissions, and system defenses (e.g., firewalls, antivirus tools). Understanding OS security policies is critical to mitigating vulnerabilities.

## 2. Linux

Linux, a Unix-based open-source OS, is prevalent in cybersecurity due to its flexibility and control. Key areas to master:

### Fundamental Linux Commands:
- **Navigating the file system**: `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`
- **Managing files**: `touch`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`
- **Editing files**: `nano`, `vi`, `cat`
- **Monitoring system activity**: `top`, `ps`, `df`, `du`

### File System Structure:
Linux has a hierarchical file system starting from the root (`/`).
- **Key directories**: `/home`, `/bin`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/usr`.
- Knowing how to navigate and manipulate files is essential for managing security configurations.

### User and Group Management:
- **Users**: Individuals with unique login credentials (`useradd`, `passwd`).
- **Groups**: Logical collection of users for access management (`groupadd`, `usermod`).
- **File permissions**: Understand `rwx` permissions for files and directories. Use `chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp` for controlling access.

### Package Management:
- **APT (Debian-based)**: Install and manage software (`apt-get`, `dpkg`).
- **YUM (Red Hat-based)**: Package manager for managing software (`yum install`, `rpm`).

### Basic Networking in Linux:
- Common networking commands: `ifconfig`, `ip addr`, `ping`, `netstat`.
- Configuration of network interfaces and understanding Linux firewall tools (`iptables`, `ufw`).

### Linux Security Best Practices:
- Regular updates, configuring firewalls, disabling unused services, setting secure file permissions, auditing logs (using `Syslog` or `journalctl`), and implementing encryption.

## 3. SQL (Structured Query Language)

SQL is used to manage and manipulate relational databases. Core concepts include:

### SQL Syntax & Data Types:
- **Basic commands**: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
- Data types include integers (`INT`), strings (`VARCHAR`), dates (`DATE`), and more.

### Creating, Modifying, and Querying Databases:
- **Creating tables**: `CREATE TABLE table_name (column_name datatype)`.
- **Modifying**: Use `ALTER TABLE` to add or drop columns.
- **Querying**: `SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition`.

### Database Relationships:
- **One-to-One**: Each record in one table links to a single record in another.
- **One-to-Many**: A single record in one table is linked to multiple records in another.
- **Many-to-Many**: Requires a join table to manage the relationship between two tables.

### Data Manipulation:
- **INSERT**: Add data to a table (`INSERT INTO table_name (columns) VALUES (values)`).
- **UPDATE**: Modify data in a table (`UPDATE table_name SET column=value WHERE condition`).
- **DELETE**: Remove data from a table (`DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition`).

### SQL Functions & Aggregates:
- Aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()` to summarize data.
- Functions like `NOW()` for date-time operations.

### SQL Security:
- **SQL Injection**: A common attack where malicious SQL code is injected into an input field.
- **Prevention**: Use prepared statements, parameterized queries, and input validation to secure databases from injection attacks.
